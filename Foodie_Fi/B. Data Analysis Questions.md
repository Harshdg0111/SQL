### **B. Data Analysis Questions**

**1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?**

```sql
/*
> FOP:
> Conditions:
> PLAN:
*/
SELECT 
	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers
FROM subscriptions;
```
**Solution :**

|unique_customers|
|-----------------|
|1000|

**2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value**

```sql
/*
> FOP:month, distribution value
> Conditions:
-- output count(month) , count *
> PLAN:
-- join subcription on plan
*/
SELECT 
  	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM start_date) AS months,
  	COUNT(*) AS distribution_values
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE p.plan_name = 'trial'
GROUP BY 1;
```
**Solution :**

|months	|distribution_values|
|----------|----------------|
3	|94
7	|89
2|	68
11|	75
12|	84
1|	88

**3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name**

```sql
/*
> FOP: plan id, plan name
> Conditions:
-- output count on customerid
> PLAN:
-- start date > 2021-01-01
*/
SELECT 
  	p.plan_id,
  	p.plan_name,
  	COUNT(s.customer_id) AS num_of_events
FROM subscriptions  s
JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE s.start_date >= '2021-01-01'
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1;
```
**Solution :**

plan_id|	plan_name|	num_of_events|
|------|-----------|------------------|

**4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?**

```sql
/*
> FOP: sum(case) , cast 
> Conditions:
-- output churn count churn pct
> PLAN:
-- join subcription on plan
-- case statement to on plan name = churn
*/
SELECT 
  	SUM(CASE WHEN p.plan_name = 'churn' THEN 1 END) AS churn_count,
  	CAST(100*SUM(CASE WHEN p.plan_name = 'churn' THEN 1 END) AS FLOAT(1)) 
              / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS churn_pct
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id;
```
**Solution :**

|churn_count|	churn_pct|
|-------------|------------|
307	|30.7|

              FROM subscriptions), 2) AS customer_pct
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE plan_name != 'trial'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```
**Solution :**

plan_name	|customer_count	|customer_pct|
|-----------|----------|-------------|
basic monthly|	546|	54.00|
